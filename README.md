Some simple exercises in Unity3D
In order to unpack a prefab locate the prefab you want to unpack. Double-click on the prefab. This will open it in Prefab Mode.
Right-click on the prefab's root object or any nested object you wish to unpack. From the context menu, choose "Unpack Prefab Completely."
 A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you want to proceed with unpacking the prefab. Click "Yes" to confirm.
 The prefab and its contents are now unpacked!
